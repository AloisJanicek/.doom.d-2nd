* 2nd generation of my .doom.d
This is my private module for [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]].
You maybe saw [[https://github.com/AloisJanicek/.doom.d][first generation]] of this config, which I archived prematurely.

** Font
I am using JetBrains Mono font with increasted line height to 1.1 via [[https://github.com/tam5/font-patcher][tam5/font-patcher]].
You can find tar archive with the font in =extras= folder.

Patching font as opposite to customization of =line-spacing= emacs variable ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Line-Height.html][39.11 Line Height]])
is essential if you want to maintain font characters exactly in the middle of the line.

** Theme
My theme setup is based on =dark+= from [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][doom-themes]].
Since vscode displays its own color theme incorrectly (see [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/issues/427][emacs-doom-themes/issue#427]]), using
RGB values from original =dark_plus.json= results in more vibrant colors. To ensure as identical look
as possible, I manually color-picked colors from vscode and remapped and customized several faces.
